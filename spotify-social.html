      <h1>Spotify Social</h1>

      <h2>01 — Project Context</h2>
        <p>In collaboration with my fellow classmates, <a href="https://maudthuland.com/" target="_blank">Maud Thuland</a> and
          <a href="http://liambrettenny.com/" target="_blank">Liam Brettenny</a>, we worked to identify possible features to add
          to Spotify's existing mobile application through hypothesizing and conducting exploratory interviews. This project is
          part of the graduate course Major Studio I in the MPS Communication Design program.
        </p>

      <h2>02 — Discovery</h2>
        <div class="steps">
          <p>Conducted exploratory interviews</p>
          <p>Grouped similar responses into categories</p>
          <p>Extracted insights and categorized them</p>
          <p>Synthesized users' needs and wants</p>
        </div>

        <p>We hypothesized that users would want to connect in person. We wanted to probe the idea of an integrated AR feature
          that would allow users to meet up in person and unlock items, songs, or exclusive content in our exploratory interviews.
          It was also important to understand users’ pain points, frustrations, likes to determine a feature that enhances the
          listening experience on Spotify.
        </br>
        Through exploratory interviews, we discovered that our assumptions were challenged by our interviewees' responses. An
        integrated AR feature was not the right fit.
        </br>
        These findings allowed us to better understand our users' needs and pivot our strategy and figure out how to create a
        social feature that facilitates social interactions in app.
        </p>

      <h2>03 — Ideation</h2>
        <p>With the above insights, we generated and ideated different ways of sharing the music experience and came up with
          3 main solutions:
        </p>

        <div class="steps">
          <p>Friend activity feed</p>
          <p>Shared songs playlist</p>
          <p>Comment on songs</p>
        </div>

      <h2>04 — High Fidelity + Testing</h2>
        <p>We added missing elements to the existing design system and jumped into high fidelity sketching of the "Social" feature:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Adding a "Social" tab to the tabs bar
            </li>
          <li>Working on the landing page and contents of the "Social" tab
            </li>
          <li>Adding a "Comments" section and other friends listening to a song's "Now Playing"
            </li>
          <li>Viewing, liking, and commenting on a song on the "Comments" page of a song
            </li>
          <li>Viewing your friend's profile to see what they're listening to, your Blend, shared songs, and recent activity
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Afterwards, we selected key frames to get users' feedback on the different solutions.​​​​​​​
        </p>
        <!-- Insert user feedback -->

        <p>We interpreted users’ feedback and iterated on all the frames to solve potential problem points.
        </p>
        <!-- Insert checklist -->
